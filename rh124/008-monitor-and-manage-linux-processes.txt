Application and jobs

* Application	= Service (NTP, NFS, rsyslog, Apache)
* Script	= Shell scripts or Commands are list of instructions eg. adduser, cd, pwd, etc.
* Process	= When you run an application it generates process
* Daemon	= runs continuely until interrupted (something continuesly run in the background)
* Thread	= Service --> Process --> thread1 --> thread2 and so on
* Job		= Run a service or process at a schedule time

Monitor and Manage Process

* When an OS boots up many programs get loaded into system memory.
  These processes or programs needs to be manage and monitored because they consume
  mainly 3 system resources like CPU, memory, and disk space.

Here are a few monitoring commands to manage system resources:

	* df command report file system disk space usage
		# shows human readable format & system file types
		$ df -hT

	* du command estimate file space usage
		# human readable format | sort size in reverse order | display contents of file in terminal
		$ du -h / | sort -nr | more
		
	* uptime command tells how long the system has been running
		# if the system is running slower response time this command is useful to see if the load is high
		$ uptime
	* top command displays Linux process
		# This command shows the summary information of the system and the list of process of threads which are currently managed by the Linux Kernel.
		# When the top command is executed then it goes into interactive mode and you can exit out by hitting q
		$ top -u username	= shows task/process by user owned
		$ top then press c	= shows commands absolute path
		$ top then press k	= kill a process by PID within top session. specify the PID to kill the process
		$ top then M and P	= To sort all linux running processes by Memory usage

		PID:	Shows task's unique process id.
		USER:	Username of owner of task.
		PR:	The "PR" field shows the scheduling priority of the process from the perspective of the kernel.
		NI:	Represents a Nice Value of task. A Negative nice value implies higher priority, and positive Nice value means lower priority. 
		VIRT:	Total virtual memory used by the task.
		RES:	Memory consumed by the process in RAM.
		SHR:	Represents the amount of shared memory used by a task.
		S:	This field shows the process state in the single-letter form.
		%CPU:	Represents the CPU usage.
		%MEM:	Shows the Memory usage of task.
		TIME+:	CPU Time, the same as "TIME', but reflecting more granularity through hundredths of a second.

		press q to get out interactive mode.

		NOTE: Top command refreshes the information every 3 seconds
			
	* free command displays amount of free and used memory in the system
		# display the amount of memory in mebibytes
		$ free -m

	* lsof command list open file
		$ lsof

	* tcpdump
	* netstat
	* ps
	* kill
	* vmstat
	* iostat
	* iftop



Process/Service Commands

$ systemctl or service	= Control the systemd system and service manager
$ ps			= allows you to see what are the processes running in linux system
$ top			= see processes in system depending on which process you wanted to see first base on load.
$ kill			= kills the process
$ crontab		= used to schedule applications, process, services to execute and become job
$ at 			= like crontab, but it schedules the process one time bases or as adhoc process
