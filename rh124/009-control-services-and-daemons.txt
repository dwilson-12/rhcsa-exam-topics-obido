Control Services and Daemons

 - Service or application when started creates processes and when those processes run continuously in the background, they become daemons
 - Most services are daemons
 - Services are controlled by systemctl
 - Systemctl is a systemd utility that is responsible for controlling the systemd system and service manager
 - Systemd is a collection of system management daemons, utilities, and libraries which serves as a replacement of System V init daemon
 - Systemd is the parent process of most of the daemons
 - The command to control services = systemctl.

# Check if systemd installed in your system
$ systemctl --version

# Check if systemd is running
$ ps -ef | grep systemd

# Check all running services
$ systemctl --all

# To check the status, start, stop and restart a service
$ systemctl status|start|stop|restart application.service

# To reload the configuration of a service
$ systemctl reload application.service

# To enable or disable a service at boot time
$ systemctl enable|disable application.service

# To enable or disable a service completely (at boot or manually)
$ systemctl mask|unmask application.service
