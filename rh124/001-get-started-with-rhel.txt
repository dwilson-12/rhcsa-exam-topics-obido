* Open sourse

	- Open-source software is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose (Wikipedia)
	- Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production. 
	  Open source software is often cheaper, more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed by communities rather than a single author or company.
	- Linux is a free, open source operating system (OS), released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). 
	  It's also become the largest open source software project in the world.
	- Red Hat Enterprise Linux is built from open source components.
