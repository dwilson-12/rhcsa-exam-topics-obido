Log Monitoring

* Another and most important way of system administration is log monitor

	- log		= /var/log
	- boot		= Logs about system boot /boot.log will rewrite if the system reboots
	- chronyd	= newer version of NTP
	- cron		= logs of scheduled crontab's are here
	- maillog	= has all the information about sendmail daemon
	- secure	= records all log in and login out activity 
	- messages	= monitor system activity/software, hardware info, application, and process (# grep -i error)
	- httpd		= web server log

	tail -f secure	= newest log at the bottom

Maintain Accurate Time

	* Maintain accurate system time is critical for log file analysis across multiple systems.
	* Also having accurate time on a system is requirement for sensitive applications such as database in production environment.
	* The network time protocol (NTP) is a standard way for machines to provide and synchronize the time to the NTP server.
	* An NTP server is a dedicated machine/computer which responds to clients for time synchronization
	* chronyd is a NTP service used for time synchronization in the newer Linux versions.

	# Command to show system time/date
		$ date

	# Command for time/date and NTP setting
		$ timedatectl

	# To get help
		$ timedatectl --help
		$ man timedatectl

	# To view list of time zone
		$ timedatectl list-timezones

	# To set a time zone
		$ timedatectl set-timezone America/New_york

	# To set time or to set time and date
		$ timedatectl set-time HH:MM:SS
		$ timedatectl set-time '2021-08-18 20:15:50'

	# To enable NTP synchronization
		$ timedatectl set-ntp true

chronyd

	* Purpose?		= Time synchronization
	* Package name		= chronyd
	* Config file		= /etc/chronyd.conf
	* Log file		= /var/log/chronyd
	* Service		= $ systemctl start/restart chronyd
	* Program command	= chronyc

	# check if there was a package

		$ rpm -qa | grep chrony

	# if you do not have chrony package installed then run:

		$ dnf install chrony -y

	# configure file

		$ vi /etc/chrony.conf
		# add this line
		server 8.8.8.8
		# start the service
		NOTE: dont run ntpd and chronyd at the same time
		$ systemctl status ntpd
		$ systemctl stop ntpd
		$ systemctl disable ntpd
		$ systemctl status chronyd
		$ systemctl start chronyd
		$ systemctl enable chronyd

	# chronyc will bring you to program mode
