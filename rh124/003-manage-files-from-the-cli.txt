INTRODUCTION TO FILESYSTEM

 - What is a filesystem?
	Ans:	It is a system used by an operating system to manage files.
	The system controls how data is saved or retrieved.

 - Operating system store files and directories in an organized and structured way
	Examples:
		* System configuration file	= Folder A
		* User files			= Folder B
		* Log fies			= Folder C
		* Commands or scripts		= Folder D

 - There are many different types of filesystems.
	e.g. ext3, ext4, xfs, NTFS, FAT etc.

DIRECTORY LISTING ATTRIBUTES

	* When you do the ls -l this is you will see.

	| Type | # of Links | Owner | Group | Size | Month | Day | Time | Name |

CREATING FILES AND DIRECTORIES

 - Creating files
	* touch
	* cp
	* vi

 - Creating directories
	* mkdir

FILE MAINTENANCE COMMANDS
	* cp	= copy a file
			$ cp [filename] [destination]
			$ cp [filename] [newfilename]
	* rm	= delete a file
			$ rm [filename]
	* mv	= rename or move the file
			$ mv [filename] [newfilename]
			$ mv [filename] [/tmp]
	* mkdir	= create directory
			$ mkdir [dirname]

	* rmdir or rm -r = delete directory
			$ rmdir [dirname]
			$ rmdir -r [dirname]
			NOTE:
			$ rm -Rf [dirname] = will forcefully remove sub-dir and it's contents as well.

	* chgrp	= change the group of the file
			$ chgrp [groupname] [filename]

	* chown	= change the ownership of the file
			$ chown [username] [filename]
				or
			$ chown username:group [filename]

SOFT AND HARD LINKS

	* inode		= pointer or number of a file on a hard disk.
	* soft link	= link will be removed	if file is removed or renamed.
	* hard link	= deleting renaming or moving the original file will not affect the hard link

 - create soft and hard links.
	$ ln
	$ ln -s

	Demo:
		$ touch [filename]
		$ cd /tmp
		$ ln -s /home/username/[filename]

 - To find the inode
	$ ls -ltri

INPUT AND OUTPUT REDIRECTS

 - There are 3 redirects in Linux

	1. Standard input (stdin) and it has file descriptor number as 0
	2. Standard output (stdout) and it has file descriptor number as 1
	3. Standard error (stderr) and it has file descriptor number as 2

 - Output (stdout) - 1
	* By default when running a command its output goes to the terminal
	* The output of a command can be routed to a file using > symbol
		* E.g. 	ls -l > listings
			pwd > findpath

	* If using the same file for additional output or to append to the same file then use >>
		* E.g	ls -la >> listings
			echo "Hello World" >> findpath

 - Input (stdin) - 0
	* Input is used when feeding file contents to a file
		E.g	cat < listings
			mail -s "Office memo" allusers@abc.com < memoletter

 - Error (stderr) - 2
	* When a command is executed we use a keyboard and that is also considered (stdin -0)
	* That command output goes on the monitor and that output is (stdout -1)
	* If the command produced any error on the screen then it is considered (stderr -2)
		* We can use redirects to route error from the screen
			* E.g	ls -l /root 2> errorfile
				telnet localhost 2> errorfile

PIPES

 - A pipe is used by the shell to connect the output of one command directly to the input of another command.

	* The symbol for a pipe is the vertical bar ( | ). The command syntax is:
		$ command1 [arguments] | command2 [arguments]
		$ ls -l | more
		$ ll | tail -1
