* Filesystem is a structured way where all files and directories are stored
* To access those files, we need navigation tools
* Following are the basic tools or commands to access Linux file system:

	- ls
	- cd
	- pwd
	- df
	- du
	- fdisk
	- Absolute and relative path (absolute path always begin with /)
	- Tilde ~
	- . and ..

# change directory
$ cd <directory>

# go back one directory
$ cd ..

# list directory contents 
$ ls		... only shows files and folders
$ ls -l		... shows in column
$ ls -lt	... shows the latest file on the top
$ ls -ltr	... show the latest file on the buttom (reverse of ls -lt)

# print name of current/working directory
$ pwd

# shows the filesystem size, used space, available space, and where the filesystem is mounted
$ df -h

# list all the disk information
$ fdsik -l

# if you attached new a disk to your OS, it allows more option to partition the disk
$ fdisk /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc	... the naming scene sd+letter depends on how many existing disk is attached

# Absolute path
$ cd /full/path/ .. if you want to go directly in the target directory

# relative path
$ cd /home
$ cd <userdirectory>
$ cd Desktop	... you go in one by one to your target directory

# Tilde ~
$ ~	.... it will bring you to your home home directory
