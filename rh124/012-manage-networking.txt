Static IP vs DHCP

	* IP stands for internet protocol which is assigned to your computer so it can access the network.
	  Private is assigned for internal communication and public is for internet/external communication.
	* Static IP does not change
	* Dynamic IP changes after system reboot

	# To check the ip address
		$ ip addr

OS Network Components

	* NIC		= Used to connect to LAN/WAN
	* MAC address	= The hardcoded address of NIC
	* Subnet mask	= The subnet mask indicates the boundary between the network and host parts of an IP address
	* Gateway	= Used when you have to connect on the other networks ($ netstat -rnv)
	* DNS		= Allows create record between hostname to IP and vice versa ($ nslookup www.google.com)

Getting started with NetworkManager

	* NetworkManager is a service and set of tools designed specifically to make it easier to 
	  manage the networking configuration on Linux systems and is the default network management service on RHEL 8 and RHEL 9
	* It makes network management easier.
	* It provides easy setup of connection to the user.
	* NetworkManager offers management through different tools such as GUI, nmtui, and nmcli.

	# Check status of NetworkManager
	$ systemctl status NetworkManager
	$ ps -ef | grep NetworkManager

Network configuration methods

* nmcli 		= Short for network manager command line interface.
			  This tool is useful when access to a graphical env is not available and can be also used within scripts to make network conf changes.

* nmtui 		= Short for network manager text user interface. 
			  This tool can be run within any terminal window and allows changes to be made by making menu selections and entering data.

* nm-connection-editor 	= A full graphical management tool providing access to most of the NetworkManager
			  configurations opstions. It can only be accessed through the desktop or console.

* GNOME Settings 	= The network screen of the GNOME desktop settings application allows basic network 
		   	  management task to be performed.

$ nmcli con show

NOTE: Use console to configure static IP and take snapshot if using virtual machine.

* Using nmcli to configure static IP

	$ nmcli device (Get the listing of network interface)
	$ nmcli connection modify enp0s3 ipv4.addresses <ipaddress/24>
	$ nmcli connection modify enp0s3 ipv4.geteway <gatewayIP>
	$ nmcli connection modify enp0s3 ipv4.method manual
	$ nmcli connection modify enp0s3 ipv4.dns 8.8.8.8
	$ nmcli connection down enp0s3
	$ nmcli connection up enp0s3
	$ ip address show enp0s3

* Adding secondary static IP using nmcli

	$ nmcli device status
	$ nmcli connection-show --active
	$ ifconfig
	$ nmcli connection modify enp0s3 +ipv4.addresses <ipadd/24>	# if has a secondary NIC
	$ nmcli connection reload <same as $ nmcli connection down/up enp0s3>
	$ systemctl reboot
	$ ip address show

Network Files and Commands

* Interface Detection
* Assigning an IP address
* Interface configuration files
	* /etc/nsswitch.conf				= It defines the lookup order for various system databases, such as user information (passwords, groups), hostnames, network information, and more.
	* /etc/hosts					= set domain name for your machine
	* /etc/sysconfig/network			= Hostname file in CentOS 6
	* /etc/hostname					= Hostname file in CentOS 7
	* /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-nic	= This is the file where you can specify your IP
	* /etc/resolv.conf				= Specifies your DNS Server

# This files can be seen on any linux distribution

* Network Commands
	$ ping			= send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hosts
	$ ifconfig		= configure a network interface
	$ ifup or ifdown	= bring up or bring down the interface
	$ netstat -rnv		= print network conn., routing tables, interface statistics
	$ netstat -tulpn	= for finding out which ports of the machine are being open by which services
	$ traceroute		= print the route packets trace to network host
	$ nslookup [hostname]	= to know what is the IP address of a hostname or websites
	$ dig [hostname]	= same as nslookup but little different
	$ tcpdump -i enp0s3	= traces every single transaction leaving and coming into the mac
	$ ethtool enp0s3	= to know the speed, status, and link speed etc.
