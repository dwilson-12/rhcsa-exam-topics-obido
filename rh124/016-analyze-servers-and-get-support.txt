* Anytime you have an issue w/ your Linux RedHat server you will have to through the
  monitoring commands such as top, free, df, du etc. A system administrator should also review
  the system logs in /var/log directory and then reach out to Redhat technical support for more help 
  (if the sysad cannot resolve the issue)

* Redhat has made it easier for system administrator to use a web-based application named 
  "Cockpit" to manage and analyze server.

* To get support from Redhat, a system administrator can run the utility sosreport or in newer
  version "sos report" on linux system as root which will collect the logs and configuration file
  and then transfer them over to Redhat support server. Now with Cockpit application, the report
  can be generated at the web-based portal.

e.g
$ sos report

Please enter the case id that you are generating this report for []:

## if you already reached out redhat support you already have a case id. Enter the case ID in the prompt. ##

Your sosreport has been generated and saved in:
	/var/temp/sosreport-file.....
## copy the file to your desktop and transfer it to redhat support

* Cockpit web-based interface provides many other functionality aside from monitoring and
  getting support from Redhat
