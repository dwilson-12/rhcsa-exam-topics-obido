tar
gzip
gzip -d OR gunzip

Purpose? If you have to transfer files from one computer to another computer or send it to someone the file size is not too large.

* Examples:

# tarring / archiving

	$ pwd
	/home/user
	$ tar cvf filename.tar /home/directory or.. tar cvf filename.tar . # put everything the files in filename.tar

# untar / extract files

	$ mkdir newdirname
	$ mv filename.tar newdirname
	$ cd newdirname
	$ tar xvf filename.tar

# compressing to reduced the file size

	$ gzip filename.tar

# uncompress to back to it's original file size

	$ gzip -d filename.tar.gz

# remove the newly created directory
	
	$ rm -rf dirname

FTP - File Transfer Protocol

	* The FTP is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network.
	* Protocol are set of rules used by computers to communicate.
	* Default FTP Port  = 21
	* The server or receiver should have the ftpd (port 21) service running.

* Process to configure FTP

	* Install and Configure FTP on the remote server
		
		Steps:

		# Become root
		# rpm -qa | grep ftp
		# ping www.google.com
		# dnf install vsftpd -y
		# vi /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf	(make a copy first)
		
		# Find the following lines and make the changes as shown below
		## Disable anonymous login ##
		/anonymous
		anonymous_enable=NO

		## Uncomment ##
		/ascii
		ascii_upload_enable=YES
		ascii_download_enable=YES

		## Uncomment - Enter your Welcome messege - This is optional ##
		/ftpd
		ftpd_banner=Welcome to blah FTP service.

		## Add at the end of this file ##
		shift+g
		# Local time
		use_localtime=YES
		:wq!

		# systemctl start vsftpd
		# systemctl status vsftpd
		# systemctl enable vsftpd
		# systemctl stop firewalld (if in production environment you need to add the rule to allow port 21 as an incoming traffic)
		# systemctl disable firewalld
		# useradd [name] (if you don't have an account)
		# exit
		$ username@hostname

	* Install FTP client on the client server

		# Become root
		# dnf install ftp
		# su - username or # exit
		$ touch filename

		## Commands to transfer file to the FTP server:
		$ ftp [ip address]
		## Enter username and password
		ftp> bin
		ftp> hash
		ftp> put filename
		ftp> bye

SCP - Secure Copy Protocol

* The SCP helps to transfer computer files securely from a local to a remote host.
  It is somewhat similar to the FTP, but it adds security and authentication.
* Default SCP port = 22 (same as SSH)

client ==> Server 	# client wants to copy a file over to server

Usage:

# Copy file from local host to a remote host SCP example
$ scp filename username@ip_remothost:/home/userdir

# From remote host to the local host /dir
$ scp username@remotehost:filename /local/directory
