* Linux system comes fined tunned by default when you install, 
 however there are a few tweaks that can be done based on system performance and application requirements.

Those are:
1. Optimize system performance by selecting a TUNING PROFILE managed by the tuned daemon.
2. Prioritize or de-prioritize specific processes with the NICE and RENICE commands.

What is tuned?

* Tuned pronounced as tune-d
* Tune is for system tuning and d is for daemon
* It is systemd service that is used to tune Linux system performance
* It is installed in CentOS/Redhat version 7 and 8 by default
* tuned package name is tuned
* The tuned service comes with pre-defined profiles and settings
  Based on selected profile the tuned service automictically adjust system to get the best performance.
  E.g. tuned will adjust networking if you are downloading a large file or it  will adjust IO settings if it detects high storage read/write
* The tuned daemon applies system settings when the service starts or upon selection of a new tuning profile.


Tuned profile			Purpose

Balanced			Deal for systems that require a compromise between power saving and performance
Desktop				Derived from the balanced profile. Provides faster response of interactive applications
Throughput-performance		Tunes the system for maximum throughput
Latency-performance		Ideal for server systems that require low latency at the expense of power consumption
Network-latency			Derived from the latency-performance profile. It enables additional network tuning parameters to provide low network latency
Network-throughput		Derived from the throughput-performance profile. Additional network tuning parameters are applied for maximum network throughput
Powersave			Tunes the system for maximum power saving
Oracle				Optimized for Oracle database loads based on the throughput-performance profile
virtual-guest			Tunes the system for maximum performance if it runs on a virtual machine
virtual-host			Tunes the system for maximum performance if it acts as a host for virtual machines

* Check if tuned package has been installed
	$ rpm –qa | grep tuned

* Install tuned package if NOT installed already
	$ yum install tuned

* Check tuned service status
	$ systemctl status|enable|start tuned
	$ systemctl enable tuned (To enable at boot time)

* Command to change setting for tuned daemon
	$ tuned-adm

* To check which profile is active
	$ tuned-adm active 

* To list available profiles
	$ tuned-adm list

* To change to desired profile
	$ tuned-adm profile profile-name

* Check for tuned recommendation
	$ tuned-adm recommend

* Turn off tuned setting daemon
	$ tuned-adm off

* Change profile through web console
	$ Login to https://192.168.1.x:9090 (cockpit)

nice/renice

* Another way of keeping your system fine-tuned is by prioritizing processes through nice and renice command
* If a server has 1 CPU then it can execute 1 computation/process at a time as they come in (first come first served) while other processes must wait
* With nice and renice commands we can make the system to give preference to certain processes than others
* This priority can be set at 40 different levels
* The nice level values range from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority) and by default, 
  processes inherit their nice level from their parent, which is usually 0.

* Process priority can be viewed through ps command as well with the right options
	$ ps axo pid,comm,nice,cls --sort=-nice


* To set the process priority 
	$ nice –n [#] [process-name]
	e.g. 
	$ nice –n -15 top


* To change the process priority 
	$ renice –n # process-name
	e.g. $ renice –n 12 PID.

* Nice value is a user-space and priority PR is the process's actual priority that use by Linux kernel.
  In Linux system priorities are 0 to 139 in which 0 to 99 for real time and 100 to 139 for users.

* Process priority can be viewed through ps command as well with the right options
	$ ps axo pid,comm,nice,cls --sort=-nice
