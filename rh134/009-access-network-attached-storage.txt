NFS & Samba

NFS

* NFS stands for Network File System, a file system developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.
* It is a client/server system that allows users to access files across a network 
  and treat them as if they resided in a local file directory.
* For example, if you were using a computer linked to a second computer via NFS, 
  you could access files on the second computer as if they resided in a directory on the first computer. 
  This is accomplished through the processes of exporting (the process by which an NFS server provides remote 
  clients with access to its files) and mounting (the process by which client map NFS shared filesystem).
* NFS conf. files = /etc/sysconfig/nfs
		    /etc/exports

Steps for NFS Server Configuration

	# Install NFS packages
		$ yum install nfs-utils libnfsidmap (most likely they are installed) 

	# Once the packages are installed, enable and start NFS services
		$ systemctl enable rpcbind
		$ systemctl enable nfs-server
		$ systemctl start rpcbind
		$ systemctl start nfs-server
		$ systemctl start rpc-statd
		$ systemctl start nfs-idmapd

	# Stop the firewall
		$ systemctl stop firewalld

	# Create NFS share directory and assign permissions
		$ mkdir /mynfs
		$ chmod a+rwx /mynfs

	# Modify /etc/exports file to add new shared filesystem
		/mynfs	192.168.12.7(rw,sync,no_root_squash)	= for only 1 host
		/mynfs	*(rw,sync,no_root_squash)		= for everyone

	# Export the NFS filesystem
		$ exportfs -rv

			/mynfs = NFS share

			192.168.12.7 = IP address of client machine

			rw = Read/write

			sync =  all changes to the according filesystem are immediately flushed to disk;
        			the respective write operations are being waited for

			no_root_squash = root on the client machine will have the same level of access to the files
					 on the system as root on the server.

* Steps for NFS Client Configuration

	# Install NFS packages
		$ yum install nfs-utils rpcbind

	# Once the packages are installed enable and start rpcbind service
		$ systemctl rpcbind start

	# Make sure firewalld or iptables stopped (if running)
		$ ps -ef | egrep "firewall|iptable"

	# Show mount from the NFS server
		$ showmount -e 192.168.1.x (NFS Server IP)

	# Create a mount point
		$ mkdir /mnt/kramer

	# Mount the NFS filesystem
		$ mount 192.168.1.5:/mynfs /mnt/kramer

	# Verify mounted filesystem
		$ df -h
	
	# To unmount
		$ umount /mnt/kramer

IF NFS SERVICE IS RUNNUNG BEHIND FIREWALL

Uncomment the MOUNTD_PORT, STATD_PORT, LOCKD_TCPPORT, AND LOCKD_UDPPORT in /etc/sysconfig/nfs

Allow TCP and UDP port 2049 for NFS.
Allow TCP and UDP port 111 (rpcbind/sunrpc).
Allow the TCP and UDP port specified with MOUNTD_PORT="port"
Allow the TCP and UDP port specified with STATD_PORT="port"
Allow the TCP port specified with LOCKD_TCPPORT="port"
Allow the UDP port specified with LOCKD_UDPPORT="port"

$ systemctl restart nfs

* To mount the filesystem in boot time add the following below at the end of /etc/fstab
-
-
-
{IP address}:{path of the shared dir}	{location to mount}	nfs	defaults	0	0	<--- this only a guide
192.168.1.11:/mynfs	/mnt/sharedir	nfs	defaults	0	0				<--- the actual


Samba

Samba is a Linux tool or utility that allows sharing for Linux resources
      such as files and printers to with other operating systems.

* It works exactly like NFS but the difference is NFS shares within Linux or Unix like system 
  whereas Samba shares with other OS (e.g. Windows, MAC etc.).

* For example, computer “A” shares its filesystem with computer “B” using Samba then computer "B" 
  will see that shared filesystem as if it is mounted as the local filesystem.

Samba (smb vs. CIFS)

* Samba shares its filesystem through a protocol called SMB (Server Message Block) which was invented by IBM.
* Another protocol used to share Samba is through CIFS (Common Internet File System) invented by Microsoft and NMB (NetBios Named Server).
* CIFS became the extension of SMB and now Microsoft has introduced newer version of SMB v2 and v3 that are mostly used in the industry.

In simple term, most people, when they use either SMB or CIFS, are talking about the same exact thing.

Samba Installation and Configuration: 

	• Take snapshot of your VM
	• Install samba packages
	• Enable samba to be allowed through firewall (Only if you have firewall running)
	• Disable firewall
	• Create Samba share directory and assign permissions
	• Also change the SELinux security context for the samba shared directory
	• Or disable SELinux
	• Modify /etc/samba/smb.conf file to add new shared filesystem
	• Verify the setting
	• Once the packages are installed, enable and start Samba services (smb and nmb)
	• Mount Samba share on Windows client
	• Mount Samba share on Linux client
	• Additional instructions on creating secure Samba share

I encounter some error package when I run "yum install samba samba-common samba-client" (repo is out sync)

Solution:
# yum clean all
# yum distro-sync
