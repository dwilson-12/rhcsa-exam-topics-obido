* What is ACL?
	ACL provides an additional, more flexible permission mechanism for file systems.
	It is designed to assist with UNIX file permissions. ACL allows you to give permissions
	for any user or group to any disc resource.

* Use of ACL:
	Think of a scenario in which a particular user is not a member of group created by you
	but still you want to give some read or write access, how can you do it without making user
	a member of group, here comes in picture ACL, ACL helps us to this trick.

* Basically, ACLs are used to make flexible permission mechanism in linux.

* From linux man pages, ACLs are used to define more fine-grained discretionary access rights
  for files and directories.

* Commands to assign and remove ACL permisions are:
	setfacl and getfacl

	# get acl information of the file
	$ getfacl [file]

* getfacl gives information about the existing information of a file

List of commands for setting up ACL:

	1) To add premission for user
		$ setfacl -m u:username:rwx /path/of/the/file

	2) To add permission for a group
		$ setfacl -m g:groupname:rw /path/of/the/file

	3) To allow all files or directories to inherit ACL entries from the directory it is within
		$ setfacl -Rm "entry" /path/of/the/file

	4) To remove entries from the ACLs of file
		$ setfacl -x u:user /path/of/the/file (for a specific user)

	5) To remove all entries
		$ setfacl -b /path/of/the/file (for all user)

NOTE:

* As you assign the ACL permission to a file/directories it adds + sign at the end of the permission
* Setting w permission w/ ACL does not allow to remove a file
